      Welcome to our Beverages page and most importantly, welcome to coffee!
      Enjoy specially prepared signature drinks from rich espresso to creamy
      lattes and icy iced coffees. Our menu—from the classic brews to something
      a little different—has just the right drink to hit that coffee spot. Every
      sip, if not to say anything about the coffee experience in store, is one
      crafted with extreme care.

          alt="The shot is taken from overhead looking down on a white, small-sized teacup with a shot of espresso. The shot is dark brown and clearly has crema in it, showing a nice pull. In contrast, the table creates a deep, dark texture in the background that works well to create rich, smooth textures apparent in the cup. The strategy overall is very simple and relates well to openness where the quality of the coffee speaks for itself."

          The espresso has a rich, dark brown color with a layer of crema on
          top, indicating a well-pulled shot. The cup is placed on a dark,
          textured surface, which contrasts nicely with the smooth, creamy
          espresso. The overall composition is simple and focuses on the quality
          of the coffee.

          alt="It's a close-up photo of a hand holding a white cup of latte while pouring steamed milk into it with another hand. Such a photo represents the skill of a pourer in his creation of a delicate heart on top of the coffee. The background has been overfocused to fully direct attention toward the creamy smoothness of the latte and the accuracy of the latte art. The warm colours in the image somehow just add to the inviting, almost artisan essence of this coffee experience."

          The milk is being skillfully poured to create latte art, forming a
          delicate heart-shaped pattern on the surface of the coffee. The
          background is slightly blurred, drawing full attention to the creamy,
          smooth texture of the latte and the precision of the latte art. The
          warm tones in the image add to the inviting and artisanal feel of the
          coffee experience.

In a beetroot latte, the other common Instagrammer shot, the same style of etching is done but in foam. These two colors standing one beside each other probably represent, most plausibly, the biggest contrast and hence the most pleasing in play: green and deep pink. A sweet decoration of small sugar cubes placed nearby is in the shape of hearts."

          The mug on the left contains a green matcha latte with a heart-shaped
          design in the frothy milk. The mug on the right holds a beetroot
          latte, also featuring a heart-shaped pattern in the foam. The
          contrasting colors of the lattes—green and deep pink—create a visually
          striking and inviting scene. Small heart-shaped sugar cubes are placed
          nearby, adding a charming touch to the presentation.
