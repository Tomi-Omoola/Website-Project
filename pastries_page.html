          It is the picture of a cinnamon roll, looking really delicious and
          tempting, stacked on a white dish. This dessert presents an entirely
          different thing when it comes into view- wholly brown, loads of
          luscious cinnamon-sugar swirls atop it. A tender icing drizzle barely
          sweetened enough to offset the spiciness of the filling inside drapes
          across the top. Soft, fluffy layers promise to just melt in your
          mouth, and that is why these are tagged as the ultimate comfort
          treats. It contains a warmly lit, blurred background with this
          cinnamon roll, representing a moment of pure and delicious enjoyment.
